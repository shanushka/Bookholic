// review:`Before the multi-million, runaway bestseller The Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown set his razor-sharp 
// research and storytelling skills on the most powerful intelligence organization on earth--the National Security Agency (NSA),
//  an ultra-secret, multibillion-dollar agency many times more powerful than the CIA.
// When the NSA's invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, 
// the agency calls its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant and beautiful mathematician.

// From the underground hallways of power to the skyscrapers of Tokyo to the towering cathedrals of Spain, a desperate race unfolds. It is a battle for survival--a crucial bid to destroy a creation of inconceivable genius...an impregnable code-writing formula that threatens to obliterate the post-cold war balance of power.

//   { id: 17, title: 'kafka on the shore',author:'o',img_url:'./assets/kafka.jpg',price:200,review:`Kafka on 
//   the Shore is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, who runs away from home 
//   either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his long-missing mother and sister; 
//   and an aging simpleton called Nakata, who never recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn 
//   toward Kafka for reasons that, like the most basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom.

// As their paths converge, and the reasons for that convergence become clear, Haruki Murakami enfolds 
// readers in a world where cats talk, fish fall from the sky, and spirits slip out of their bodies to
//  make love or commit murder. Kafka on the Shore displays one of the world’s great storytellers at the 
//  eak of his powers.`}
